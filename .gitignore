# ==================================================================================== #
#  In a .gitignore file, the double asterisk (**) is a powerful wildcard that          #
#  matches zero or more directories. It is used to create recursive patterns           #
#  that can ignore files in nested subdirectories.                                     #
#                                                                                      #
#  The meaning of the double asterisk depends on its position within a pattern.        #
#                                                                                      #
#  **/ (Leading double asterisk)                                                       #
#    A leading **/ followed by a file or directory name will match that item any-      #
#    where in the repository's directory structure. This is useful for ignoring a      #
#    file or folder regardless of how deeply nested it is.                             #
#      • Pattern: **/temp                                                              #
#      • Matches: temp (at the root), build/temp, src/app/temp                         #
#                                                                                      #
#                                                                                      #
#  /** (Trailing double asterisk)                                                      #
#    A trailing /** at the end of a directory name matches all files and subdirec-     #
#    tories inside that directory, and all files in nested directories.                #
#      • Pattern: logs/**                                                              #
#      • Matches: logs/debug.log, logs/production/error.log, logs/archive/old/log.txt  #
#                                                                                      #
#                                                                                      #
#  /**/ (Double asterisk between slashes)                                              #
#    When placed between two slashes, a double asterisk matches zero or more inter-    #
#    mediate directories.                                                              #
#      • Pattern: a/**/b                                                               #
#      • Matches: a/b, a/x/b, a/x/y/b                                                  #
#      • Purpose: This is helpful for ignoring files with a specific name that appear  #
#                 anywhere within a particular subdirectory tree.                      #
#        • Example: logs/**/*.log ignores all files ending in .log inside the logs     #
#                   directory and all of its subdirectories.                           #
#                                                                                      #
#                                                                                      #
#  Comparison: * vs **                                                                 #
#     * : NON-recursive and only matches characters within a single directory segment. #
#    ** : RECURSIVE and can cross directory boundaries.                                #
#                                                                                      #
