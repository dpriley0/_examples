1. Running the app in the background
To run the app as a background process, change the python
extension from pomodoro.py to pomodoro.pyw. This simple trick
allows for your program to run from hidden command prompt,
and prevents you from accidentally closing it. Now you can
double-click on the file, and your timer will open!
